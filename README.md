Crossy Road / Cross the River

This project was the Day 23 Capstone project of Angela Yu of London's App Brewery, the top Python programmming bootcamp. In the past projects, I've been experimenting with OOP and GUI creation. This game was a really interesting, and challenging exercise of those concepts. 

As opposed to the course version of the game, my game is different in several regards. The original game presented by the course spawns new cars at a random y coordinate within the frame (600 x 600). This means that there can be cars that are 'colliding.' To add a more real effect, I added the lanes logic. This not only means the cars only spawn at the center of a lane 1-10, but the turtle is only able to jump from the center y-coordinate of a lane to the center y-coordinate of the lane above. 

Let me know what you think!
